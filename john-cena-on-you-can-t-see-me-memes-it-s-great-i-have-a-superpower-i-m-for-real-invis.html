Not once [does John Cena gets sick of the ‘You Can’t See Me’ jokes.] I went through a stretch where I was like, ‘Man! This has got some staying power.’ Because the first time I heard it, it might have been ’09. It’s 2024 bro. And I still am invisible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-john-cena-trolled-by-jake-paul>John Cena trolled by Jake Paul</h2><p>Cena also shared the story about how he was so excited to meet Jake Paul but Paul made fun of Cena with the infamous meme as well.</p><p>“I was so f***ing happy to meet him [Jake Paul]. An inspiration to me. I was moved by the Doc [Jake Paul documentary]. I thought it was so vulnerable and great. And for someone like I said, to start so late and achieve fluency and mastery so quickly, is a just a byproduct of hard work, effort. I… I’m drawn to passion and effort. I’m like, ‘Yo’ [Goes to shake hands with Jake]. He goes over here [shakes hands with mid-air] ‘John hey.’ [Cena said to himself] ‘Oh my god! I got to do the thing one more time. I got to be invisible one more time.’ It’s great. Dude, I have a superpower. I’m f***ing for real invisible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The former WWE Champion also mentioned that he is pleased with all the jokes and memes. Cena sees it in a way that his work has affected the viewers in some way shape or form.</p><p>“You said in the car about the South Park gimmick. The South Park episode. You were pleased. Yeah, what am I supposed to say? Does it hurt my feelings? No. It’s your way of saying, ‘Your work affected me some way.’ It’s f***ing awesome right?” John Cena said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNscGxtZWK3sLTNZpqeppFivK952KisZpuRo8Fuv8SeZKadXaKyrrHSZqBmoJGrsm6tjKysqZ2ipby4sdFmoKZllqS%2Fbr7EmqNmoZ6rtrS1waWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
