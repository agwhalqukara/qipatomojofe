He also appears to have had a lot of personal success, particularly in his love life. He’s had some amazing times, whether in his previous romance with Charlie Theron or in his current marriage to Agatha Araya.</strong></p><h2>Charlie Theron and Stuart, the Time’s Power Couple</h2><p>Despite his scandalous circumstances, the actor has a lengthy and profitable dating history. He had an affair with Charlize Theron, a Hollywood A-list actress, for about a decade.</p><p>He met her on the set of their film Trapped, and the two were in love for many years. Indeed, Theron mentioned him during her winning speech at the 2004 Academy Awards.</p><p>Townsend described his interaction with the actress in a 2004 interview with Irish America. He reasoned that she appeared to be worth a million dollars. As the actor recalls lovingly,</p><p>“‘Whoa!’ I exclaimed. Who is this young lady?”</p><p>Despite their attraction, they both chose to stay legally unattached. The ex-lover also agreed not to marry until same-sex marriage was legalized in the United States.</p><p>Even though they were not officially married, the couple referred to themselves as wedded on multiple occasions. Stuart remarked in a People magazine interview in 2007 that,</p><p>“We didn’t get married in a church or anything, but we’re married. We’re a husband and wife team.”</p><p>The gushing didn’t stop either! They appeared to be completely in love and to be taking their relationship very seriously. The actress even praised the writer-director for their mutual love of Vogue.</p><p>“I’ve previously been in love. But have I ever been with someone who I honestly believed had my best interests at heart and was my best friend? No, not till Stuart arrives.”</p><p>But, just when their love seemed too perfect to be true, the promise rings they exchanged subsequently became a foreshadowing of their breakup. His girlfriend was seen without the ring during the Hope for Haiti telethon on January 22, 2010, fuelling speculation that they had broken up. And, unfortunately, they did.</p><p>Unfortunately, the rumors were true, and Theron allegedly ended their relationship. The actor has moved on and now has a wife and children.</p><p>With success coming and going, Townsend’s film career never really took off. Even he had to relinquish the role of Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings trilogy to actor Viggo Mortensen. Despite this, the writer-director is supported by his family during the highs and lows of his career.</p><p>No information regarding their wedding has been disclosed because he chose to keep his marriage private following his public breakup. However, nothing is known about his marriage and wife based on the minimal information that has been published.</p><p>The actor is married to Agatha Araya, with whom he has two children, one of them is Desmond Townsend. His wife is Costa Rican, and the couple has been dating since 2013.</p><p>However, due to sad occurrences, the truth about his failing marriage began to make headlines in 2019.</p><p>In September of that year, authorities arrested the 48-year-old actor at his home in Santa Monica, California, on domestic assault allegations. It was revealed that the actor had a violent argument with his wife, prompting their neighbors to call the cops to complain noise.</p><p>According to reports, the disagreement almost turned physical when he grabbed his wife’s arm and refused to let go. As a result, he was imprisoned for a few weeks until being released at the end of October 2019 after the court ordered him to pay $50,000 in bond.</p><p>According to the allegations, he was also charged with false imprisonment. Fortunately, his wife did not press charges against him, but their relationship remained strained. They appear to have put their differences aside rather than arranging a divorce because they are still together and living together.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Notyourgothgirlfriend</a>, <a href=#>Medukarabu</a>, and <a href=#>Lili Sixx</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Mimí Ardú</a></h3>Mimí Ardú estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
