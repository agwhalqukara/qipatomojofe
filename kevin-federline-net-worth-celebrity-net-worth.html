They split up before Kaleb was born, and Kevin began dating Britney Spears. The couple became engaged in July 2004 after three months of dating, and they married on September 18th of that year. Federline and Spears weren't legally wed until October 6th because of a delay in the finalization of their prenuptial agreement. Kevin and Britney had two sons, Sean (born September 14, 2005) and Jayden (born September 12, 2006), before divorcing in July 2007. Though they initially agreed to 50-50 custody of their sons, Kevin later requested that it be changed to 70-30, and Britney lost physical custody in October 2007.</p><p>On January 3, 2008, police responded to "a custodial dispute regarding Britney Spears's children," which resulted in Spears being taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center because she seemed to be "under the influence of an unknown substance." After the incident, Federline ended up with sole legal and physical custody of Sean and Jayden. Britney had visitation rights, and court papers that were filed in July 2008 gave her more time with the children and stated that she must pay Kevin $20,000 per month in child support. The former couple later went back to 50-50 custody, and in August 2019, they formally changed the custody agreement to 70-30 custody in Federline's favor.</p><p>Kevin went on to marry Victoria Prince on August 10, 2013, and they have two daughters, Jordan (born August 15, 2011) and Peyton (born April 4, 2014). In 2013, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Federline because he owed $57,615.39 in back taxes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6Cyt7XNZp2enJWnuaq6xGalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
