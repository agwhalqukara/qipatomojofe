We honestly don’t know what we would do without shapewear! When we want to rock a more form-fitting ensemble, we rely on our shapewear pieces to leave Us with the smoothest silhouette possible. But that said, there are a plethora of problems we’ve run into with shapewear pieces in the past — the most annoying of them being when they don’t stay in place."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But that said, there are a plethora of problems we’ve run into with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shapewear pieces</a> in the past — the most annoying of them being when they don’t stay in place.</p><p>We’re specifically talking about the roll-down effect — you know, when the top of shapewear shorts or panties starts folding in to create a bump we don’t want to see. But that’s where <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these shorts from Maidenform</a> are different! They offer features which make them stay up and stay put, and reviewers say they’re seriously slimming to boot.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Maidenform Minimizing High-Waist Fajas Shapewear</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$14</a> at Amazon!

They scooped the item up to help flatten out the tummy area and smooth down cellulite, and that’s exactly what the piece accomplished. The product extends incredibly high, which is crucial — because that’s one detail which prevents them from rolling down. Depending on your shape, they can go as high as directly underneath the bust!</p><p>And at the top of the waistband on the inside, there’s a thin line of invisible silicone which helps the shorts grip to the skin — further preventing them from budging out of place. It’s these dainty details which make <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this shapewear staple</a> incredible — and why it’s such a hit with shoppers!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Maidenform Minimizing High-Waist Fajas Shapewear</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$14</a> at Amazon!
