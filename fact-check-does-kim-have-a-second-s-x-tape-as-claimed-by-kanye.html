During the October 2021 episode, Kardashian kissed now-boyfriend&nbsp;Pete Davidson&nbsp;during&nbsp;an&nbsp;Aladdin&nbsp;sketch&nbsp;while West was sitting in the audience.</p><p>He said;&nbsp;“How you gonna bring me to&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;and kiss the dude you’re dating right in front of me? And everybody’s like, ‘Oh that’s cool.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“After I went and got the laptop from Ray J myself that night and then got on a red-eye [flight]. I met this man at the airport, and got on a red-eye, came back [and] delivered it to her at 8 a.m. in the morning.”</p><p>“And then, I gave it to her and she cried when she saw it.</p><p>“You know why she cried when she saw the laptop? Cause it represents how much she’s been used. It represents how much people didn’t love her and they just saw her as a commodity.”</p><p>However a rep for Kim Kardashian confirmed that there was a laptop, but they denied any existence of of a second s*x tape on the hard-drive,</p><p>She said: “The computer and hard drive collected were supposed to contain the original video and any unseen footage. After review, there was nothing sexual unseen, only footage on the plane on the way to Mexico and footage at a club and restaurant on the same trip.</p><p>“Kim remains firm in her belief that there is no new second tape that exists. After 20 years, she truly wishes to move on from this chapter with focus instead on the positive things she continues to do as a mother, entrepreneur and advocate for justice reform.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOn5icrF2YtaavymabqJ2jYriquYyhmK%2BdXZZ6tLHCqKWdZaOterWtz55kmqtdmLmitcyem2aaqWK4orrYnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
