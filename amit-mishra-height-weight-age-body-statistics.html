The record was previously solely held by former Indian pace bowler Javagal Srinath who had set it in a 7-match ODI series against New Zealand in the 2002-03 season. The record had stood unrivaled as of May 2021.</li><li>In a group-stage match of the 2014 Asia Cup, against Pakistan, he had produced a miserly spell of 2/28 from his quota of 10 overs. These were the 6th most economical 10-over bowling figures in the tournament’s history.</li><li>In the ODI series, during New Zealand’s 2016–17 tour of India, he had picked 15 wickets in 5 matches helping India ace the series by a margin of 3-2. In the last match of the series, with the score level at 2-2, he had produced a magical spell of 5/18 from 6 overs to skittle New Zealand out for a paltry total of 79 in a chase of 270. His performance had seen him win both the ‘Player of the Match’ and the ‘Player of the Series’ awards.</li><li>With 16 dismissals in 9 matches, he was the leading wicket-taker for Haryana in the 2018–19 season of the Vijay Hazare Trophy (India’s premier domestic one-day cricket competition).</li><li>In April 2013, he had become the first bowler to record 3 hat-tricks in the IPL. As of May 2021, he was the only bowler to have achieved the feat.</li><p>Featured Image by Amit Mishra / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpqkoqxdora0tNGaZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
