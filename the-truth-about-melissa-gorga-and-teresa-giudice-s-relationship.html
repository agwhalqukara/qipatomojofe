Apparently, Melissa — who joined the show in Season 3 (Teresa started in Season 1) — did so without telling her sister-in-law. "Well, unfortunately, that was the one sad thing for me throughout this whole show, not only the legal stuff but the family stuff," Teresa explained in November 2019, per <a href=#>The Sun</a>. "My family came on the show, behind my back, and that was the worst thing that could have ever happened to me."</p><p>That caused a lot of tension between the sisters. The viewers saw it play out firsthand over the proceeding seasons. Things are all good now, though. With everything Teresa has been through on the show, her sister-in-law joining the cast behind her back is the least of her worries. Jennifer Aydin confirmed as much on a <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a> appearance in February 2020, "I think they definitely get along better than they once did," she said. "But they're not the best of friends, to be honest," she added, to which Melissa agreed.</p><p>"Do we love each other? Are we family? Yeah," Melissa explained. "But would I raise my hand and say, 'Let's be best friends?' I don't know. And I don't know if she would, either." Sounds complicated!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3BjbH1ze9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2isq210qyYZp%2Bfp7SiecCnm2aslaeytK2MoKCunJmYsrR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
