However, not every light fixture hanging from a ceiling is a chandelier. For us to regard a light fixture as a chandelier it has to feature multiple lamps. Also, it should have more than one layer and be used as ambient lighting.</p><p>There are so many types of chandelier lights on the Nigerian market. They come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. We have come up with a price list after surveying the market on your behalf.

With this out of the way, let’s look at some important information about chandeliers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=types-of-chandeliers-by-function></span>Types of Chandeliers By Function<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There are several types of chandeliers as you would have seen from the list above. In this section, we will look at the classification of chandeliers according to their function.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=uplight-chandeliers></span>Uplight chandeliers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The chandeliers in this category, just like their name suggests, focus their light upwards. This means that the lights bounce off the ceiling to reflect around instead of directing the lights downward.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=downlight-chandeliers></span>Downlight chandeliers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>These chandeliers are the direct opposite of the uplight chandeliers. They present us with the traditional or regular style of chandeliers. In this case, the light is directed downwards without any obstruction. Downlight chandeliers are ideal when there is a need for direct and focused light in a room.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=ambient-chandeliers></span>Ambient chandeliers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Asides from downlight chandeliers, all other chandeliers aren’t designed for lighting up a room. What they are meant for is adding to the ambience of a room. This means that any chandelier that is installed for improving ambience is known as ambient chandeliers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-chandeliers></span>What To Consider When Choosing Chandeliers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You don’t just walk into a store and purchase any chandelier that you see. There are certain factors that you must consider before making such a purchase. In this section, we will discuss the most pressing of these factors.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-position-of-the-chandelier></span>The position of the chandelier<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This is the first thing that you must consider before buying a chandelier. Where do you intend to install the chandelier? Your answer to this question determines what kind of chandelier you will purchase.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=purpose-of-the-chandelier></span>Purpose of the chandelier<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>We have described the three different types of chandeliers by the function above. You must first determine the purpose of the chandelier before you decide on which one to buy. For example, if you need a chandelier that will also light up a room, you need a downlight chandelier. Figuring this out makes it easier to narrow down your choices.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=installation-height></span>Installation height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>You don’t just install chandeliers at any height, there are specific prescriptions. For example, a chandelier installed in your dining room should be just about 30 inches above the table. This will make it possible for everyone to see their food and each other’s faces without stress. In other rooms, you must consider the ceiling height so that people don’t walk into your chandeliers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There you have it for the prices of chandelier lights in Nigeria. We have also explained the categories of chandelier lights by function and how to choose chandeliers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C4yKyraJuYlrulscuinKtlnJ60qcDSZqeroZOaeqq6jKegoJ2inq5w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
