Strasburg re-signed with the Washington Nationals for $245 million over seven years. Anthony Rendon signed the same deal with the Los Angeles Angels.

He was accused of drawing out negotiations, stalling things in the name of scoring big deals.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But it looks like Boras knew what he was doing after all. And it's created the most exciting baseball offseason in recent memory. Teams are willing to spend whatever it takes to get a big star.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For example, a team like the Angels is the first team ever to have three players on the roster with contracts worth at least $240 million. In addition to Rendon, the team re-signed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Trout</a> to an extension that will pay him $426.5 million when all is said and done. The Angels also inked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Pujols</a> to a 10-year, $240 million contract in 2011.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Expect to see even more of this moving forward. While the biggest stars have already signed this winter, Boras could be setting a precedent in future offseasons.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And if he keeps scoring big deals like he has this year, he'll be laughing all the way to the bank.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqyaqKykYq%2BwvsCsqmasmKeypnnBop6gnaOpeq64wWadq52VYq6osc2tZJykmZq7tb%2BMoZivnV2arrO6xJ1kcWlkYrqquMuipqdlmJq%2Fpr%2BMoaawZZ2qsKl5x56jpWWdlrimew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
