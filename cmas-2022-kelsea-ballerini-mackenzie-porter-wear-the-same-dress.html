She donned a blue, long sleeve Balenciaga gown for the occasion, the same one worn by Ballerini, 29. Kardashian, 41, previously wore the iconic bodycon dress to the <a href=#>Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty</a> in May.</p><p>The two country singers distinguished their looks for the evening by <a href=#>accessorizing the garment</a> differently. Ballerini wore matching built-in gloves and gold earrings while Porter, for her part, skipped the handwear and chose turquoise earrings. The “Seeing Other People” singer attended the award show with her husband, <a href=#><strong>Jake Etheridge</strong></a>. The duo tied the knot in July 2020.</p><p>Ballerini, meanwhile, flew solo after <a href=#>settling her divorce</a> with <a href=#><strong>Morgan Evans</strong></a> last month. The “Peter Pan” songstress announced the split via her Instagram Story in August shortly after she filed for divorce after more than four years of marriage.</p><p>“Friends, I’ve always tried my best to share my life with you in a real and vulnerable way, while also protecting layers of my personal life as they unfold,” the Grammy winner wrote at the time. “This is now public record so I wanted you to hear from me directly that <a href=#>I am going through a divorce</a>.”</p><p>Evans, 37, hinted at the time that the decision wasn’t fully mutual. “I am very sad to confirm that after almost five years of marriage, Kelsea and I are parting ways. I <a href=#>wish it were otherwise but sadly it is not</a>,” the “Kiss Somebody” crooner wrote in an Instagram post of his own.</p><p>The former couple<a href=#> tied the knot in December 2017</a>, one year after getting engaged. During an October appearance on CBS Mornings, Ballerini said that there was no drama between her and her ex-husband.</p><p>“It’s not chaotic. It’s not, like, volatile. It just didn’t work, and that sometimes is, like, a difficult narrative to get your head around when you’re like, ‘Oh, my gosh. This is a good person. And I’m a good person. And <a href=#>this is just no longer good anymore</a>,” she explained.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Evans was also in attendance at the 2022 CMA awards and alluded to his divorce while talking to Access Hollywood on the red carpet.</p><p>“[I] have a brand new song out — it’s called ‘Over For You’ — which is very personal and kind of heavy but [it] has also been a really great experience sharing that and just seeing the reaction to that and seeing how much it means to so many people,” the Australia native said. “<a href=#>It’s been a rough few months in my life</a> and writing this song just really helped me sort through a lot of that. … The hardest part of [going through a divorce] is how lonely it feels and it’s strangely comforting to realize that so many other people have been through it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5i6or%2BMa2dral2gsq2%2FxJpkm5mcobKztc2iZKaZk6Cyr8bInmSpp6KpsrN51p6Yq2WknbJuv8CmnGacoprAtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
