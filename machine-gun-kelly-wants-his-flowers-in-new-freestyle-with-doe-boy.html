His last two albums, 2022’s Mainstream Sellout and 2020’s Tickets To My Downfall, were both pop-punk centered albums.</p><p>“I’m going to make a rap album for myself,” he told Audacy last year. “For no other reason, no point to prove, no chip on my shoulder. If I keep doing things to prove things to people, I’m going to one, drive myself crazy, and two, not make a good product. I made Tickets and Mainstream Sellout because I wanted to make them. I need to now also make people miss that sound.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I’m going to do this tour and I’m gonna step into where I left Hotel Diablo and expand on my storytelling as a rapper and find a new innovative sound for the Hip Hop Machine Gun Kelly. That’s where my excitement is and where me as a music archaeologist wants to explore.”</p><p>His first offering from the forthcoming effort is the dynamic three-part track, “Pressure.” Listen to it <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mikmpuYnrumecaupWajlaG5unnKoqOlmV2Yrq55xaucnqukrrmmecOonGaan656uK3TnJ8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
