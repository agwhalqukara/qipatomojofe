Finally, Love Yourself: Answer also includes six new tracks, such as “Trivia: Just Dance,” “Trivia: Love,” “Trivia: Seesaw,” “I’m Fine,” “IDOL” and “Answer: Love Myself.” BTS has not distinguished any of these songs as being their next single.</p><p>The group teased some of the themes on this album with the release of their <a href=#>concept photos</a> and “<a href=#>notes</a>” series, which explains some events in the group’s long-running narrative.</p><p>Love Yourself: Answer will be released on August 24th. Unlike previous comebacks, the group will be debuting the songs live through their <a href=#>upcoming tour</a>, rather than through <a href=#>television performances</a>. BTS’ tour is named after their Love Yourself series and will see the septet travel to different parts of Asia, North America and Europe. Their final tour stop will be in Queens, New York at <a href=#>Citi Field stadium</a>. It will be the group’s first U.S. stadium show and and also the first time a K-pop group will ever perform there. Tickets for the show went on sale on Friday, August 17th and <a href=#>sold out within minutes</a>.</p><h3>Will you be seeing BTS on tour?
