In previous Instagram posts, they've also referred to it as the most "peaceful spot" in the summertime.&nbsp;</p><p id=edutFJHe-4j data-wc=36>It's been a turbulent few months for the TV stars, so we can imagine the walled garden has proved an idyllic retreat. Their latest post follows the news that Channel 4 had terminated their working relationship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/0fad501e8013-3269135538827826197100284161154787474667363n-1.jpg><p id=e-4WoJUiWI_ data-wc=58>Back in May, it was confirmed that the broadcaster had officially cut ties with Dick and Angel. According to Deadline, the decision was made following an independent investigation into the couple's conduct on the show. It was reported that concerns were initially raised by Two Rivers Media – the production company behind the Escape to the Chateau franchise.</p><p id=eUfC6SNLiiW data-wc=26>&nbsp;It also stated that the couple had been clashing with producers, with an independent HR professional conducting an investigation that included interviewing producers and crew members.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/8a0be196328f-dick-and-angel-on-escape-to-chateau.jpg><p id=elF3iHxUL-f data-wc=57><a class=hm-link href=#>In an official statement</a>, a Channel 4 spokesperson said: "Following a review, we have taken the decision not to work with Dick and Angel on any new productions in the future." Two Rivers quickly followed suit, announcing: "We can confirm that we will no longer work with Dick and Angel and cannot comment further at the moment."&nbsp;</p><p id=ek9LOzeKGib data-wc=58>By late May, Angel was involved in another headline-hitting story after an audio recording where <a class=hm-link href=#>Angel can be heard&nbsp;</a>using offensive language to a crew member was leaked to the media. The Strawbridges responded by releasing a statement on Instagram. "It was a Strawbridge Family decision early last year to conclude Escape To The Chateau," the couple explained. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/d8cc6003f9fb-angel-strawbridge-blue-dress.jpg><p id=elldPQfZQWOK data-wc=54>"We know there are lots of stories in the press right now. It's not worth us even trying to comment or give context, because anything can be made into a good headline. We understand. There are two sides to every story and from the incredible support we have received, most of you know that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/fda00fdf8349-dick-angel-strawbridge.jpg><p id=eDRbSSxXxAVA data-wc=75>"We are proud of who we are, and we feel we must do what we believe to be correct, that is in fact what kept Escape to the Chateau unique, and whilst we have indeed parted ways with Channel 4, we are hugely grateful to them and their teams for their support and creativity over the years. The future truly could not look more exciting and we thank you for your continued love and support."&nbsp;</p><p id=eFIywYxXHqAx data-wc=26>Currently, it looks as though the Strawbridges have no TV appearances planned, however, <a class=hm-link href=#>they have announced their plans to embark on a UK tour in 2024</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcG9qYmp8pr%2FCmqeeZaSkerW0xGaaoZmkmq62ecCnnp6kXZm2pLeMrKurmaeXv6qwxp5kq52mmq6tedKapZyspZa%2FunnCoZinppWhenV5w6uYpplf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
